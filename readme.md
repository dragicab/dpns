# Implemented Algorithm and other available options


### Here we use ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) which is a feature detection and description algorithm commonly used in computer vision for tasks such as object recognition, image registration, and image stitching.

### There are also more methods where we can achieve the same result with SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features),BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features):
